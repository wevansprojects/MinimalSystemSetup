#configuration script for remote access
#Note using the format below we can easily extract
#the data because python parses it as a string

user: username 
password: password
port: 22
privatekey: /home/username.ssh/privatekey

#However if we did the same thing like this
#Python would interperate it as a list which needs
#us to convert into a string if we need a specific value
#so be very careful how you use yaml formatting
#That said if we use a for loop we don't need to convert
#as the forloop will extract each element as a string in the
#list and parse it to any commands we choose
