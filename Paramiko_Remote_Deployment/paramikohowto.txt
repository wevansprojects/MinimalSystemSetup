# How to visualize using Paramiko to Remote SSH and deploy

In this folder we can see multiple files examples of how to use
Paramiko and SSH to install uninstall and schedule cron jobs on a server

A Remote Installer Script
A Remote Uninstaller Script
A Remote Cron Script
A Remote UnCron Script
A Remote Update Script
A Remote Deploy Script

With these script examples we can combine them administer multiple servers
Remotely.

We should also pay attention to the fact that I only care fore Redhat or Debian.
So there will need to have one other folder with the above scripts doing the same
but for a Redhat or Debian distribution.
