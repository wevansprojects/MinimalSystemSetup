# MinimalSystemSetup
Minimal System Deployment Templates.
Install a minimal system and run these scripts to build multiple testing environments. 
These scripts will help will take care of the basics and leave you with the foundations to build upon.
I have included scripts to setup a simple NGINX Server and some debian desktop utilities.
I also include a backup tool which can work offline and also with a SAMBA Server.
